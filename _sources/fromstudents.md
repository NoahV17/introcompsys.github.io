# Why take this class

You should take this class if you want to be introduced to some topics prior to taking 411 and 412. This class also allows you to gain some experience using the terminal, understanding the term `computing` and the topics surrounding it, and using version control systems such as git which are useful in the professional world. 

This class offers great experience with real world computer science tools like github. This class will also expose you to 
intermediate computer science concepts. In total the skills learned in this class will make you a much more rounded computer science student. 


You should take this class if you want to know more about what your computer is doing. This class will help you better understand error messages and will teach you bash
scripting and git. I have not taken 411 yet but I hear this class is good to take before 411. I also believe this class is good to take before 305 because we use git a lot in that
class.

You should take this class if you want to get a headstart on your education and
career. This class covers quite a bit, but each topic is designed to give you
just enough so that you're not completely in the dark when you have to learn
this stuff for a class. Additionally, being comfortable with version control
systems is essential for not only school projects, but also your internships
and jobs.


You should take this class if you want to understand more of a real software developer's workflow 
and begin to create your own code in a more professional way. The level of comfort that I have 
gained with Git is something that I believe will be invaluable to me as I enter my career as a 
professional developer. Getting more comfortable with working in the terminal and using simple 
bash scripts to automate tasks is another thing that I learned in this class which greatly increased 
my work efficiency. Getting introduced to some of the core topics for 411 and 412 ahead of time 
is also a huge benefit to this class as it will save you a ton of time when taking those courses.


You should take this class if you want to learn more about git, github, and how to use the terminal.


YOu should take this class because it introduces you to new concepts about computer science. It helps 
you gain experience/knowledge about real world applications. For example, we go over a lot of github 
commnads and the many things you can do with github. This will help you in the real world but also while 
your still in school. Currently, I am stil only in CSC 212 but I have already used github a bunch. With 
this class, I can now use github better.
